# BIO_tools

NOT really a project.

As a learning process, these are the tools that I built specifically for my study of MBT76, featuring Biopython module 1.68 upwards.
I hope these codes can be easily adapted to other genomes.

The scripts are not essentially built for more efficient study work flow, but it is the ultimate goal.
